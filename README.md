# DS9000_Credit_Card_Transaction_Classification
Credit card fraud has caused significant financial losses for individuals and institutions worldwide, undermining trust in financial systems and highlighting the need for effective preventive measures. Detecting such fraud poses a significant challenge primarily due to the highly imbalanced nature of transaction datasets, where fraudulent cases are rare. This project addresses fraud detection using machine learning approaches. To address this highly imbalanced dataset, we will use some pre-processing techniques like feature selections and resampling. Feature selection was conducted using correlation analysis and ANOVA tests to identify variables most relevant to fraudulent activity. Advanced classification algorithms—including Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, Random Forests, and Neural Networks—were trained on resampled datasets using undersampling and oversampling methods. The performance of these models was evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their effectiveness in handling this problem, offering valuable insights into fraud detection.
